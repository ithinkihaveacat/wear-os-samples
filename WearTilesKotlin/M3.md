To get e.g. edgebuttons, you need a renderer with version major=1,
minor=>303

See hasAsymmetricalCornersSupport() in Versions.kt (internal only)

This doesn't seem to be available on any production builds.

To get it, you need to install a custom build of the renderer on a
userdebug build.

To get the device into the right state:

go/flashstation, and select the appropriate userdebug build.

To get the APK, either: (1) build yourself via blaze

See
https://g3doc.corp.google.com/company/teams/android-wearos/developer/sub-teams/tiles/renderer_apk.md?cl=head#install-the-apk

(This doesn't seem to produce a binary compatible with the emulator
unfortunately.)

Or (2) install this prototype (not personally tested):

https://flash.android.com/tools/prototypes/j2EybcjKpqu3saPfCgnuoAZbFBFldbBQ

Once installed, this APK should report a version >303, and
edgeButton() will produce a bottom-hugging edge button.
