# Rules

- Do not modify the file GoldenTilesColors.kt, and do not use any of the values defines there.

# Useful Resources

The full source code to the tiles and protolayout libraries is available in the files
samples/tiles.txt and samples/proto.txt, which you may consult for your
reference.

Also in this directory is some sample code to produce layouts. This code is missing the support
infrastructure (i.e. the service to create the layouts, etc.), but the layout function calls are
syntactically correct. You may wish to consult the sample/*.kt files in this directory when dealing
with layout issues.
